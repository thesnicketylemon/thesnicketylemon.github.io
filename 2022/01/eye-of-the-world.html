                <h1>The Eye of the World Book Review</h1>
                <span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/reading/eye_of_the_world.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p><strong>TL;DR Recommendation</strong>: If you’re a fantasy series fan and enjoy stories that have intricate world-building and storytelling,
then the Wheel of Time series is for you. If you enjoy nuanced characters and fantasy series’ that are dark and gritty, then
this is not the series for you.</p>

<p>I was looking for an alternative to the A Song of Fire and Ice (ASOIF) series and stumbled onto The Wheel of Time (WoT) series.
I’m still salty that ASOIF may never be fully completed. So the fact that Robert Jordon wrote extensive notes so that the series 
could be completed posthumously made me want to read WoT even more.</p>

<p>The first book in WoT is called The Eye of the World. I started reading it with the hope that it would be a good substitute
for ASOIF, but WoT resembles the Lord of the Rings series (LOTR) way more than it does ASOIF. The world building in WoT is 
fantastic and I loved learning more about each region and creature that was introduced so far. However, the gritty tone
and the uncertainty of whether main characters would survive that I loved in ASOIF is very much absent in WoT.</p>

<p><strong>SPOILERS AHEAD</strong></p>

<p>You can tell right off that the main characters are pretty much invincible, and no task is too insurmountable for them.
So far, none of them particularly stand out to me with the possible exceptions of Morraine and Lan. But it’s also 
not that easy to flesh out so many different characters and creatures within the scope of one book. I’m interested to 
learn more about Rand’s father and see what the journey is ahead for Nyaneve, Rand, Mat, Perrin, and Egwene.</p>

<p>What I really enjoyed is Robert Jordan’s portrayal of magic in this world. Magic can be wielded only by women in this world, 
and men who try to wield magic eventually go insane. This makes women unusually powerful, which is a nice change of pace
from other fantasy series’ written in that time period. I’m curious to see how women are treated as the series progresses. 
So far, I love that magic has consequences (e.g. Morraine’s energy is drained whenever she wields magic and she cannot replenish 
her own energy) and I like that there’s at least a bit of depth to the female characters.</p>

<p>I also like how word-of-mouth is the main way of defining what’s right and wrong in this series. While the characters
themselves are fairly black-and-white, their perception to other humans is very gray. Aes Sedai is considered bad news in
the Twin Rivers but as our main characters venture out into the world, they are forced to depend on the good graces of Morraine, 
an Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>The interaction that Rand has with Aginor and Balthamel towards the end of the book was what let me down. It felt so
anti-climatic and odd compared to the rest of the book for me. When I finally finished the book, I was conflicted because
the rest of the book felt so promising.</p>

<p>Regardless, I am plowing onward and reading The Great Hunt, which is Book 2 in this series. Here’s hoping that the current
momentum of the series continues.</p>
