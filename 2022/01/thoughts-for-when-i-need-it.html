                <h1>Carpe Diem, maybe?</h1>
                <span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/musings/carpe_diem.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>I’m in a very interesting point in my life currently. My personal and professional life are stable and my mental health is at an 
all-time high. I know, I know. ‘Tis is merely fleeting in the chaos that is life. But I thought it would be a good idea to document
the things I do now so that future demented-me can read this and use it to reset.</p>

<p>So here are the rules sane-me follows:</p>

<h3 id="time-is-currency-so-ruthlessly-prioritize">Time is currency. So ruthlessly prioritize.</h3>
<p>Your time is the only thing you control. There are always a million things to do all the time every day. It’s the 
unfortunate reality of being in the ‘always hustling’ mindset. So spend your time on tasks that have some kind of return;
whether that’s monetary, cerebral, or relaxing. Make sure that you’re never in a state of having to play catch-up.</p>

<p>Life is too short to be in analysis-paralysis mode or in the catch-up mode.</p>

<h3 id="make-your-money-work-for-you">Make your money work for you.</h3>
<p>This is a privilege: that you don’t need to live day-to-day. So use your money: invest it, spend it on things that will
save you time on tasks so that you can ruthlessly prioritize on other tasks.</p>

<p>That trip that will give you happiness? Take it.</p>

<p>That high-end product that won’t break on you and make you spend time 
on finding on alternative? Buy it.</p>

<p>If that extra money in the bank gives you mental satisfaction, then keep it. That counts too.</p>

<h3 id="dont-let-perfect-get-in-the-way-of-good">Don’t let perfect get in the way of good</h3>
<p>You will never get enough time so that you can sit, reset, and then do your task to completion so that it’s absolutely 
perfect. Iteration is a part of life. Aren’t you iterating your way to a better version of yourself?</p>

<p>If you have 15 minutes to spare, spend on something, anything, that you have prioritized in your mind. That 15 minutes
will help prevent from the 1 hour of gnawing guilt that happens in your brain later.</p>

<p>Come back and make it better. It’s easier to critique and make it better than try to get to perfect the first time.</p>

<h3 id="think-in-bets-and-move-ahead">Think in bets and move ahead.</h3>
<p>Think through your choices using the information you have in hand and make a choice.
If you made the right choice, then great! If not, then see what you got wrong that made you choose wrong.
If there’s no way you could’ve gotten the information before you made that choice, then YOU MADE THE BEST POSSIBLE CHOICE.
There’s no point in worrying over it anymore. Move ahead.
If there was a way to get that information, bookmark it, write it down, and try not to do it again.</p>

<p>Rinse and repeat.</p>

<h3 id="seize-the-day---kind-of">SEIZE THE DAY - Kind of</h3>
<p>As John Keating says, “There are only as many days in the year as you make use of.”
If you need to seize the day to do absolutely nothing to recharge and reset, do it.
If you need to seize the day to get all the million things you need to get done, DON’T DO IT. You’ll just get depleted.
Instead, use the previous night to ruthlessly prioritize your things down to a manage-able task-list and <em>Carpe Diem</em> 
by all means!</p>

<h3 id="floss">Floss</h3>
<p>Dental care is expensive. So floss every night.</p>
