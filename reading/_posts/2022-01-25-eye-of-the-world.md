I started The Wheel of Time series in the hope of finding 
a Game of Thrones alternative that was at least completed.
They are both fantasy epics, but the similarity ends there.

The Wheel of Time has fantastic world-building and the main 
characters, while fleshed out, do seem invincible. Quite unlike
Game of Thrones.
