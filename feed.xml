My personal and professional life are stable and my mental health is at an 
all-time high. I know, I know. ‘Tis is merely fleeting in the chaos that is life. But I thought it would be a good idea to document
the things I do now so that future demented-me can read this and use it to reset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are the rules sane-me follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-is-currency-so-ruthlessly-prioritize&quot;&gt;Time is currency. So ruthlessly prioritize.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your time is the only thing you control. There are always a million things to do all the time every day. It’s the 
unfortunate reality of being in the ‘always hustling’ mindset. So spend your time on tasks that have some kind of return;
whether that’s monetary, cerebral, or relaxing. Make sure that you’re never in a state of having to play catch-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is too short to be in analysis-paralysis mode or in the catch-up mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-your-money-work-for-you&quot;&gt;Make your money work for you.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a privilege: that you don’t need to live day-to-day. So use your money: invest it, spend it on things that will
save you time on tasks so that you can ruthlessly prioritize on other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That trip that will give you happiness? Take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That high-end product that won’t break on you and make you spend time 
on finding on alternative? Buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that extra money in the bank gives you mental satisfaction, then keep it. That counts too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-let-perfect-get-in-the-way-of-good&quot;&gt;Don’t let perfect get in the way of good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will never get enough time so that you can sit, reset, and then do your task to completion so that it’s absolutely 
perfect. Iteration is a part of life. Aren’t you iterating your way to a better version of yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have 15 minutes to spare, spend on something, anything, that you have prioritized in your mind. That 15 minutes
will help prevent from the 1 hour of gnawing guilt that happens in your brain later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come back and make it better. It’s easier to critique and make it better than try to get to perfect the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;think-in-bets-and-move-ahead&quot;&gt;Think in bets and move ahead.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think through your choices using the information you have in hand and make a choice.
If you made the right choice, then great! If not, then see what you got wrong that made you choose wrong.
If there’s no way you could’ve gotten the information before you made that choice, then YOU MADE THE BEST POSSIBLE CHOICE.
There’s no point in worrying over it anymore. Move ahead.
If there was a way to get that information, bookmark it, write it down, and try not to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seize-the-day---kind-of&quot;&gt;SEIZE THE DAY - Kind of&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As John Keating says, “There are only as many days in the year as you make use of.”
If you need to seize the day to do absolutely nothing to recharge and reset, do it.
If you need to seize the day to get all the million things you need to get done, DON’T DO IT. You’ll just get depleted.
Instead, use the previous night to ruthlessly prioritize your things down to a manage-able task-list and &lt;em&gt;Carpe Diem&lt;/em&gt; 
by all means!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;floss&quot;&gt;Floss&lt;/h3&gt;

then the Wheel of Time series is for you. If you enjoy nuanced characters and fantasy series’ that are dark and gritty, then
this is not the series for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking for an alternative to the A Song of Fire and Ice (ASOIF) series and stumbled onto The Wheel of Time (WoT) series.
I’m still salty that ASOIF may never be fully completed. So the fact that Robert Jordon wrote extensive notes so that the series 
could be completed posthumously made me want to read WoT even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first book in WoT is called The Eye of the World. I started reading it with the hope that it would be a good substitute
for ASOIF, but WoT resembles the Lord of the Rings series (LOTR) way more than it does ASOIF. The world building in WoT is 
fantastic and I loved learning more about each region and creature that was introduced so far. However, the gritty tone
and the uncertainty of whether main characters would survive that I loved in ASOIF is very much absent in WoT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPOILERS AHEAD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell right off that the main characters are pretty much invincible, and no task is too insurmountable for them.
So far, none of them particularly stand out to me with the possible exceptions of Morraine and Lan. But it’s also 
not that easy to flesh out so many different characters and creatures within the scope of one book. I’m interested to 
learn more about Rand’s father and see what the journey is ahead for Nyaneve, Rand, Mat, Perrin, and Egwene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really enjoyed is Robert Jordan’s portrayal of magic in this world. Magic can be wielded only by women in this world, 
and men who try to wield magic eventually go insane. This makes women unusually powerful, which is a nice change of pace
from other fantasy series’ written in that time period. I’m curious to see how women are treated as the series progresses. 
So far, I love that magic has consequences (e.g. Morraine’s energy is drained whenever she wields magic and she cannot replenish 
her own energy) and I like that there’s at least a bit of depth to the female characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like how word-of-mouth is the main way of defining what’s right and wrong in this series. While the characters
themselves are fairly black-and-white, their perception to other humans is very gray. Aes Sedai is considered bad news in
the Twin Rivers but as our main characters venture out into the world, they are forced to depend on the good graces of Morraine, 
an Aes Sedai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interaction that Rand has with Aginor and Balthamel towards the end of the book was what let me down. It felt so
anti-climatic and odd compared to the rest of the book for me. When I finally finished the book, I was conflicted because
the rest of the book felt so promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I am plowing onward and reading The Great Hunt, which is Book 2 in this series. Here’s hoping that the current
momentum of the series continues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">TL;DR Recommendation: If you’re a fantasy series fan and enjoy stories that have intricate world-building and storytelling, then the Wheel of Time series is for you.
